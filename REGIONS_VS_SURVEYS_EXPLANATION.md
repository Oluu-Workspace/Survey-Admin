## 🔗 **HOW THEY WORK TOGETHER**

### **Survey Assignment Process:**
```
1. CREATE SURVEY
   ├── Define research objectives
   ├── Set target responses (e.g., 50,000)
   ├── Choose target regions (e.g., Kiambu County)
   └── Select specific areas (e.g., Juja + Kabete constituencies)

2. ASSIGN AGENTS TO REGIONS
   ├── John Mwangi → Juja Constituency
   │   ├── Murera Ward (Target: 200 responses)
   │   └── Theta Ward (Target: 150 responses)
   └── Mary Wanjiku → Kabete Constituency
       ├── Gitaru Ward (Target: 180 responses)
       └── Muguga Ward (Target: 170 responses)

3. COLLECT DATA
   ├── Agents visit assigned regions
   ├── Collect responses from residents
   ├── Submit data via mobile app
   └── System tracks progress by region
```

### **Real Example:**
```
Survey: "Household Economic Research 2024"
├── Target: 50,000 responses across Kiambu County
├── Regions: Juja + Kabete + Kiambaa constituencies
├── Agents: 45 field agents assigned to specific wards
├── Progress: 37,800 responses collected (75.6% complete)
└── Status: Active (collecting data)
```
